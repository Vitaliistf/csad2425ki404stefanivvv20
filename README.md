# Details about repository

This repository contains a project for a "Rock Paper Scissors" game, built using Arduino Uno and C++. The logic will run on the Arduino Uno, which will be the server for the game, while the C++ QT application will be used as a GUI for users interactions.

# Task details

## Task 1

Main goals:

- Create repository with main branch named **develop**.
- Create branch with name **feature/develop/task1**.
- Create `README.md` file with project details.
- Create **GIT TAG**.
- Create a pull request.

## Technologies and Hardware

### Programming Language

- **C/C++**: Used for both server-side and client-side to develop the game logic and GUI.

### Software

- **Arduino IDE**: To write and upload the logic code to the Arduino Uno, using C++ for low-level control.

- **QT Creator**: Used for creating GUI that displays the game view and allows users to interact with the game progress in real time.

### Hardware

- **Arduino Uno**: The board will handle game logic, which includes processing game state, managing inputs, and sending outputs to the client application.
